Hey Priscila. I'm Chris an Data Engineer in the Personalization Squad in the Food Alliance. I wanted to notify you that last week I filed a case for a transfer hearing with the Works Council due to hardship. 
@juergen.helmers
 made me aware that you are our HR rep. I just wanted to check with you if you aware of that process and if there is anything I can do on my side to help that process. Thank you.

Hi Chris, thank you for reaching out. Thank you for the notification, the process is not owned by HRBPs, and it will be reviewed by our legal and C-level team, together with the WoCo. They will be the ones providing you updates on this - I do not think there is anything needed from your side atm, but they will for sure let you know in case they need further information. Thank you!
