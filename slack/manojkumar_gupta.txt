Hi/


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  3:33 PM
What is DE work needed for Lyre/Harp/Koto project and stabalization of our data pipeline?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  3:35 PM
well first of all. we need to have some redundancies in case I'm not available which is also the plan since the Food Alliance re-org that finished about a month ago
For the current work load it would be really good to have at least on other DE so one could do support while the other is doing discovery tasks
We should also work more closely with the data alliance / integrate better into the data mesh by creating high quality data assets and certify them for wider use in the organization. For now we only use them internally but they would have value to other squads as well
(edited)


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  3:44 PM
Also for some context. We asked for a DE at the beginning of the year and AFAIK we got headcount for one more DE. There was the added challenge, added by Ivan, that the DE has to have substantial BE experience which I don't see why that is sooo important. And AFAIK Vanya had candidates that would fit our needs but would fail the added constraint of having to have BE experience


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  3:55 PM
redundancy is really good point you brought up (edited) 
3:55
do we work in situation where we integrate our solution with other or develop so that others can also use it?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  3:57 PM
At HF we follow the Data Mesh architecture were the domain teams are responsible for creating data assets and supporting them. So whenever we create new assets, as we did for Lyre, we ideally should document and publish them so that other teams can use them
3:59
in the past platter for instance was depending on our data. Since there was no real plan for DE in the Food Alliance I proposed to separate both data pipelines (lyre and platter) so that each team would be more flexible.


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  6:48 PM
Today where we are with pipelines for Lyre and Harp and also lets consider AddOn
6:49
And Any ballpark estimates you would like to share if we have to deliver these projects?  (edited) 
6:49
Please consider possible improvements and platformizing effort for these pipeline
6:51
I am looking for some sort of roadmap for DE work. It need not be accurate. It should be list of things we should be doing for these projects and building infrastructure for our team with their estimates  (edited) 
6:52
This will help me propose stronger case for the need of one more engineer  (edited) 


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  11:23 AM
sure.  give me some time


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)

yes we will pair the next weeks and go ever some past PRs and what I'm currently working in so that he get's up to speed with the dev process, our infra, tech real estate and stakeholders

where I can search available table and their data? ex: fact_tables.recipes_in_menu


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  2:47 PM
you can search the data catalog for available tables https://hellofresh.atlan.com/assets
2:48
and then you can use photon to query the data
2:48
you can also use the catalog browser in databricks

Perfect! Thanks. Behind the scene all the data stored on S3 only, right?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  2:54 PM
mostly. except for snowflake they use a proprietary storage system which might be backed by s3 but I don't know
2:55
when I joined there were also some legacy tables in CDP (Cloudera Data Platform) and HDFS


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)

Ah.. another thing, we list down on challenge have with CDP.

Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  1:00 PM
this data is captured. someone must to storing somewhere. Last communication with Cooper and James was it is not stored in DWH/Backend
1:00
What I know is that this data still there in GAevents


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:02 PM
but is there a backend service that's handling this data? Maybe we could start searching from this angle


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  1:04 PM
There was a idea to build survey service. we dont know what is the status of it. we are figuring-out the owners (edited) 
1:05
meanwhile, I thought if there is way to dig it out from DWH or not


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff

For Harp CA ETL data quality check, DS saying that they are blocked because of our work. how did we do this in case of Harp GB? Didnt backtesting independent of DE work?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  3:45 PM
somewhat. but to fully test it they need to see how many weeks in advance they have how many recipes. For that they need the ETL
3:46
but we have it planned for this sprint and I'll start with it tomorrow. I talked to them and a low effort implementation, i.e. taking the GB etl and simply run it in CA as well is enough for them. So without data analysis on our end

Hi Chris, good morning!
When we will be completing lyre-ml pipeline migration?
9:01
Our Data engineering task has been in very slow progress, what do you think? Do you think we could do something here?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:08 AM
I could open a PR for lyre-ml but the data is not ready. Do you think I should open a PR in draft, close the ticket, and start working on customer behaviour?
9:09
I think customer_behaviour is more important right now for closing tardis migration.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:15 AM
And I agree with your assessment of the slow progress, IMHO there are a couple of factors:
I was too ambitious with the changes, I wanted to solve all the problems at once but I don't know how else since these early design decisions impact future initiatives
Over time we had a solution in mind that didn't involve tardis and to be honest tardis is just not as capable as Airflow + Cosmos + dbt


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:17 AM
I think so.. Lets create a PR in draft and we come back to it later. Lets focus on customer behavior
9:18
Is tardis team aware of our requirements? We have dependency mapping for 2025. If you share small write up then i can ask them to look into it next year and plan properly


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:19 AM
I can do it. Can it wait till next week?
9:19
Can we have a quick call?


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:23 AM
Yes, i will mark as dependecy. Give me two or three lines of description and next week you onboard me with details that we will take up to discuss with Tardis/data platform team.
9:25
Today was last date but we got it extended for this week. We can connect tomorrow for this. You can create PR for lyre-ml. And lets start customer behavior task
9:26
We can create follow up ticket and for end to end testing we should be creating anyways
9:26
If basic skeleton working fine then we can conclude this ticket


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  8:13 AM
Hi Chris
8:13
Good morning!
8:14
after yesterday’s call i think we have simplified the data need and at the same time we are building scalable and one time solution. Thank you so much for taking up the discussion.
8:16
Would you like to post the summary of yesterday’s call on respective channel?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:27 AM
Yes I can do it. But after you've left they gave us another big problem that they have when forecasting and that is predicting the allocation. So when the experiment start we have 0% loyalty 0 customers allocated to the experiment but as time goes on this number grows. Now we can make an educated guess  about the number of allocated customers week+1 after the experiment start , but this is also something only we now since we're setting up the experiment. 
@Paritosh Gupta
 and I are trying to create a solution where we give an estimate for every customer choice (no-pork+no-beef, no-pork, etc.). But yet another problem is we cannot do that yet (it seems) since we don't know the distribution of these selectections. Once we have them, after first customers had this feature available, we can forecast the distribution of the multipreference/protein exclusion distribution and combine that with the forecast of the customer allocations and the real distribution of default slots and have a pretty accurate forecast
9:27
I'll write a more concise summary in the channel


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:30 AM
Yes, please. Did we discuss what MVP and good-to-have sort of stuff?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:31 AM
yes. paritosh already has an mvp for the allocation forecast I'll just need to add the multi-preference data to my solution and then we can combine the data


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:32 AM
Sure. I think we can state what is MVP to start experiment on w47 and good-to-have. Leadership only cares for Protein exclusion project and bare minimum data needed for forecasting. We can discuss in planning as well.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:34 AM
just for context. protein exclusion and multi-preference cause different rules to take effect in CMS/RBE but are both communicated via multipreference string, right?


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:36 AM
you mean preselection string?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  9:37 AM
I mean how does a customer select no-pork/no-beef? Is it also via the survey where they can also select the multiple preferences?
9:37
and is it part of the profile service data then?


Manojkumar Gupta (Manoj)
  9:39 AM
Multipreference is preference selection while customer onboarding.. And Protein exclusion is Survey


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff

Hey Manoj. This morning I had an appointment with the employment agency and hence left my hometown later. I'll arrive at 12 at Alexander platz and would directly come to the team lunch . (edited)
