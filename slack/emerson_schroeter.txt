Hey Chris! Thanks again for stopping by today. I've done some research and the two year thing I had in my memory was related to something else entirely. I've consulted with the rest of the WoCo and no one has seen anything about a 2-year rule on promotions. If it exists, it isn't a formal guideline and certainly not one that the Works Council would have supported. It's also not detailed in the manager guidelines for FOODIE promotions.
1:41
I hope this helps.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:43 PM
Thank you very much. I'll raise it in m next 1-on-1


Emerson Schroeter
  1:44 PM
Good luck--and let me/us know how we can support further.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:44 PM
I will


Emerson Schroeter
  1:58 PM
Following up further: there may be a 1- year guideline for internal mobility--but that's when you're changing roles/teams entirely.
1:59
In any case, given the way this has gone for you, if you feel like escalating let us know and we can talk about the grievance process. Especially if you have documentation!

Hey Emerson. Sorry to reach out to you outside WoCo consultation hours. As you've mentioned in hour past consultation there's now a way to request a transfer hearing regarding hardship stemming from the new Hybrid Work Policy. I filed a request. No my questions are:
Does this pending request has any affect on my and the mandatory presnece in the office
Do I need to show some kind of good will to help my case
Thank you for your time. (edited)

Hey, good morning :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks for reaching out. I would say that if possible you should show up/comply with the company/team days that are defined or request "remote domestic" days in Workday. It really depends on your relationship with your lead.
I'm not quite sure what you mean with your second question--but I think as long as you're in touch with your lead in a positive way and taking care of your work tasks as you already do (I remember you'd talked about glowing performance evaluations), this is good enough! Goodness knows that's plenty to ask when there's additional hardship imposed on you. But let me know if you had something else in mind here and I can give it a think.
Hope you're coping with things okay in the mean time!

Thank you. Yeah the seconds question was more a continuation of the first, i.e would it hurt my case if for the time being I request absence (remote  work) and not complying 100% with the Hybrid Work Policy

10:59
But as far as I can tell I'm in really good standing with my manager and skip managers

Yeah, I would just come when you can and request remote domestic days when needed. I understand they may have a limited "budget" on these days, but a good relationship with your manager will help with that.

Hi 
@Emerson Schroeter
 I have something of an urgent WC request. Are you still with the WC?

Emerson Schroeter
  1:14 PM
Hey! I am still on the works council, though with more limited involvement after some extended leave. But If i can't help, I can get you connected with someone who can!


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:17 PM
Cool thank you. I have a call scheduled with my line manager and HR in 15min, titled quick sync . Rumour has it that it's because of my non-compliance with the hybrid works policy. How should I behave? My strategy would be to make no commitments and don't accept any agreements that would be not beneficial for me. Full context I already got two warnings letters from HR. Am I entitled to have an WC rep in this meeting, or should I first let them talk and then ask for another meeting with WC present?


Emerson Schroeter
  1:18 PM
Oh wow, okay. What time is the call exactly?


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:18 PM
1:30


Emerson Schroeter
  1:18 PM
Okay, and do you want a WoCo person in the call or just to talk strategy?
1:18
Either is fine
1:19
I think you're spot on with making no committments. Accept nothing, sign nothing.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:20 PM
I feel like first going in alone could be seen as being coorperative, but if they want to talk termination I would stop them and ask for a meeting with WC being present


Emerson Schroeter
  1:20 PM
Makes sense
1:20
IF they offer you an MTA, please do state that you want to work and that you are continuing your work at your usual capacity.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:21 PM
what's MTA?


Emerson Schroeter
  1:21 PM
mutual termination agreement
1:24
So responding fully to your questions:
Behave as you normally do with this person
If they mention a PIP or MTA, Be clear that you are willing to and ARE working at full capacity--and sign nothing, agree to nothing
You can take your time with anything they give you and consult with WoCo about anything you want. If it's about legalities, you'll want to discuss with an actual lawyer
If you feel pressured or uncomfortable at any point, you are 100% within your rights to tell them that you need time to think and consult with WoCo/lawyer, etc.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:25 PM
thank you very much that helps tremendously.
1:26
I hope the next WC will not be the alternative where HR is also WC


Emerson Schroeter
  1:26 PM
Omg, same.
1:27
And I'll be around a while longer today, so if you need to chat/talk after, please don't hesitate to reach out.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:27 PM
Thank you so much...


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  1:56 PM
Okay I'm back. They told me I'm terminated immediatly, the process has already started, they have informed WC and only wait for the confirmation from WC (which they estimate takes until friday). So monday would be my last day of work, they not even giving me until end of month for a full salary


Emerson Schroeter
  2:01 PM
Okay, wow. Sorry this is happening. Let me know if there's something specific you want/need right now. Not sure the details or legalities of your specific situation, but I reached out to others on WoCo while you were on the call and got some more information.
They have informed the Personnel committee (WoCo), and someone will reach out to you this afternoon to gather information and offer some general advice. I've just now sent them an email with everything I remember from our conversations so that they have some of that context, but feel free to fill them in.
From what I know, the advice will definitely include consulting with a lawyer. Do you have legal insurance? My understanding is that that's the best and easiest way to handle it. If you're in a union, they may also be able to provide support. If you need a lawyer, the one's WoCo usually recommends are Marc Repey or Anna DKA. (edited) 


Emerson Schroeter

I need to sign off for a while--but Davide or Deborah or someone else from Personnel will reach out to you soon to talk next steps. My guess is that they will object to the case (to your benefit), which will help build a stronger case for any legal steps you want to take.


Christoph Brücke-Wendorff
:zap:  2:20 PM
Thank you. I already got an email from Lola. I'll definitely miss the WC and all the good work they have been doing despite all the resistance.


Emerson Schroeter
  2:25 PM
Okay, glad she already reached out. And fingers crossed for the election. If you decided to take legal steps (and from a personal standpoint as a fellow employee, I hope you will), it might not change Monday--but I hope you get some wins out of this. Such nonsense and I'm so sorry you're having to deal with it.
