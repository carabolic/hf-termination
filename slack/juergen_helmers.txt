Morning. Dilip told me that he is not aware from HR that you filed a hardship application.
The ticket or form you filed is that for HR or the WoC that will do this on your behalf?
Does the application from the WoC perspective negater the need to be i teh office 3 x a week?
Do you need to be here 3 x a week to improve the chnaces of approval of the request?
10:25
Let''s make sure we close the loop here. WoC is nice but HR needs to have received the request

Moin. The form I used says that it will be forwarded to HR and WoCo

I can forward the automatic reply to You, Dilip and Manoj if that helps (edited)

To your point 2 and 3 I don't know. My intuition would tell me that 3 shouldn't be the case as it could be interpreted in way that complying the policy is in fact possible, but that's just a guess
10:43
My POC at the WoCo was off sick the beginning of the week I hope to hear back from them today

Can you check with 
@Priscila Bonnes
 if HR received your request and indicate the steps you took and if there is a gap, ask her on how to bridge it

Moin. Just FYI; I didn't hear back from WoCo about my hardship case but I contacted 
@Priscila Bonnes
 and she told me that these cases will be reviewed not by HR but Legal, C-level and WoCo. So let's see :fingers_crossed:

Moin!
9:51
Thanks for the update Chris! You were on my list for a check in today so: *snap*! Did they provide you with an ETA? And did you get a recommendation from either WoC or HR on how to deal with the in office requirement?

WoCo told me to come to office on mandatory days or request absence (remote work domestic) . As for the case: on the form it says they come back within 7 business days and I submitted it last week Tuesday, so I hope to hear back today.

Hey there!
@Dilip Saha

Have you created a HR ticket by know (or the WoC on your behalf?)
For general exceptions from the hybrid policy, you need to officially raise a ticket in Workday under Flexible Working - Domestic Remote. This is then checked by our People Service and Legal team and only approved if all criteria are met. (edited)

Hi Jürgen. Sorry for the long delay but I was on leave. Yes I heard back from the WoCo and unfortunately they said they will not going to bring my case to HR (they can't), they said:
 In the cases of the needs of caretakers and those with unreasonable commutes, the company has not agreed to consider these exceptions and refused to issue transfer hearings for the Works Council to weigh in.
They also asked my if I have asked my manager / leadership for a remote contract. Which we also explored without luck.
